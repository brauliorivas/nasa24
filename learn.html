        <p>
          Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are atmospheric gases that trap heat from the
          sun, contributing to the Earth's "greenhouse effect." This effect
          helps regulate the planet’s temperature by allowing sunlight to enter
          the atmosphere, where some of it is absorbed by the Earth's surface
          and re-radiated as heat. Greenhouse gases absorb and re-emit this
          heat, preventing it from escaping back into space, thus warming the
          Earth.

        </h3>
        <p>
          Carbon flux refers to the transfer of carbon between Earth's systems,
          such as the atmosphere, oceans, and land. Positive carbon flux occurs
          when carbon is released into the atmosphere, increasing CO₂ levels.
          This happens through processes like burning fossil fuels,
          deforestation, and respiration. Negative carbon flux removes carbon
          from the atmosphere and stores it elsewhere. Examples include
          photosynthesis, carbon sequestration, and ocean absorption. Managing
          these fluxes is crucial for controlling atmospheric CO₂ and addressing
          climate change.
