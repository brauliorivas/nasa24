        Inventory for Anthropogenic CO₂ (ODIAC) from China and Japan between the
        years 2000 and 2022.

      How do we exactly know the effects of the climate change? Think of climate
      as a giant system where each one depends on each other. For example, the
      water cycle can be modeled as a simple circular cycle of evaporation,
      condensation, and precipitation, but there is more into it. So, warmer
      temperatures intensify the water cycle, leading to more evaporation (and
      thus drought) and heavier rainfall when the accumulated moisture is
      released.
      <br />

        If we take a look at MiCASA

        , we can see that globally, is releasing more carbon dioxide than what
        it can store, thus worsening the chain of interelated climate factors,
        accelerating world temperature increase, where red sectors mean is
        releasing more greenhouse gasses and blue sectors those where its being
        stored more than being released.

        For instance, you could take a look at this graph from the Greenhouse
        gas And Air Pollutants Emissions System (GRA²PES) dataset where is shown
        the amount of metric tons for carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen
        oxides, sulfur dioxide and particular matter during July 2021.

      <p>
        With a population of 8+ million people, the most amount of carbon
        dioxide is emitted from transportation, power supply and residential or
        commercial use. Its clear that big cities are the ones with most
        emissions. We need to give people the enery they need, but today's
        rhythm could cause the earth collapse and affect many of us.
